DESCRIPTION:

A responsive one-page portfolio website created with HTML and CSS can be found in this repository. This project is intended for developers and creatives and functions as a digital CV that presents contact details, skills, and personal projects in an orderly and clean manner.

In addition to offering simple navigation between sections like About, Projects, Skills, and Contact — all within a single scrollable page — the webpage showcases the person's work in an eye-catching manner.

Project Goal :

To design and implement a basic yet professional portfolio website using only HTML and CSS, with a fully responsive layout that works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.

Technologies Used :

HTML: Provides the structure of the page, including navigation, sections, and content elements such as text, images, and links.

CSS: For responsiveness, layout, styling, and interactive visual effects (like transitions, hover states, and fluid scrolling).

Features of responsive design: made to work on screens of all sizes, including tablets, smartphones, and PCs.

One-page layout: Section-based design and fluid scrolling for simple navigation and a better user experience.

Navigation Bar: To provide easy access to various sections such as Home, About, Projects, and Contact, use a fixed or top-scroll navbar.

Project Showcase: A section specifically designed to showcase academic or personal projects, complete with links and synopses (if available).

Clean Aesthetic: A neat layout that makes use of contemporary design concepts, semantic HTML, and structured CSS.

Contact Section: Provides links to social media or email addresses so that prospective employers or partners may get in touch.
